# GuessNumber
Simple game where you guess number chosen by computer. 

The game process is looped until user decides to stop, each run is separate guess game where computer gives you some tries to guess the chosen number and answering if the try was winning or losing or if your number is less or more and you have some more tries

The project's intent was to make a fast first glance on Go language [Golang](https://golang.org/), on the website you can find infos and SDK to build project from source and run the game

It has some mature elements taken from previous experience in other languages, such as [Maps](https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action)

You could define range of guessing number via `min` and `max` variables, and count of tries via `maxTries` variable. 

Also, I've tried to make code as readable and elegant as I could (but with maybe some foreign style as for Go)
